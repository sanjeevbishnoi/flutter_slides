// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility that Flutter provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

//import 'package:flutter_web/material.dart';
//import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
//import 'package:test/test.dart';
//import 'package:tk.slides/models/navigation_item.dart';

// Testing doesn't seem to work yet for widget in flutter_web because of the
// fork. Can only do unit testing at this point.

void main() {
  /*test('Test NavigationItem model', () {
    final navigationItem = NavigationItem(text: 'test', link: 'testlink');

    expect(navigationItem.text, equals("test"));
    expect(navigationItem.link, equals("testlink"));
  });*/
